## 🚀 Features

### Services & Persistence
- **StorageService**: Persistent storage management with `GetStorage`.
- **UserService**: Reactive user state management and session persistence.

### Authentication
- **LoginController**: Input validation, state management using `obs` and `Obx`.
- **LoginPage**: A sleek login UI built entirely with GetX, no scaffold used.
- **Automatic user data persistence** after login.

### Navigation & Routing
- GetX routing with automatic bindings.
- Smart redirection depending on login status.
- Clean navigation using `Get.offAllNamed()`.

### Best Practices Applied
- Professional naming conventions: `snake_case` for files, `camelCase` for variables.
- Proper use of `GetBuilder`, `Obx`, and reactive `obs`.
- Clean dependency injection with Bindings.
- Persistent services (`UserService`, `StorageService`).
- Clear separation of concerns: controllers, services, models.
